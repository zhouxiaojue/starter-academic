title: Functional Connectivity During Action Recognition Modulated By Top-down Goals
event: Society for Neuroscience, 2020

location: Chicago

summary: Functional connection between pSTS and IFG modulated by attention.
abstract: "The IFG and pSTS are more connected when attending to action than when attending to actor identity. This is consistent with the hypothesis of top-down information from IFG shaping action encoding in the pSTS."
