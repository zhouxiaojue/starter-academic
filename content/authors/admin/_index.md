I am currently a graduate student at University of California, Irvine working at visual perception and neuroimaging lab ([VPNL](https://vpnl.ss.uci.edu/ "Lab website")) with Prof. Emily Grossman. My main research interest is to how we understand someone else's action in a complex social environment through modeling action perception using fMRI data. I model fMRI data with tools such as machine learning and statistical models. 


During spare time, I have a lot of interests. Recently I am trying to make a perfectly sweet espresso and become Ping Pong master in VR.
